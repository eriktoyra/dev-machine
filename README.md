# dev-machine

This is my personal [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) provisioned development machine configuration. It is very much tailored for my needs. Feel free to use, but use it at your own risk.

Tested on _macOS 10.12.x_.

## Getting started

By running the line below, you'll start bootstrapping my development machine on your local machine.

```
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eriktoyra/dev-machine/master/bootstrap.sh)
```
